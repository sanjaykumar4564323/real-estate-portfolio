<strong>2. Design and Implementation</strong>
Give a detailed description of the design and implementation of your project. 
<hr>

Created a HTML page for each page in the website
<br/>
Linked Bootstrap & Font Awesome along with custom CSS file
<br/>
created CSS & JS folder
<br/>
followed basic layout (used bootstrap grid system)
<br/>
Decided to use MapBox to created a custom map with locations on my Search page
<br/>
Created full page scroll animations for my Testimonial page (kind of works)
<br/>
Used Embedded Google Form for Contact page (its functional)
<br/>
added social media links along with Phone number and email.

<h5>End Result:</h5>
I tried my best to do eveything thing that I had on my original design, and some worked better than others. I watch some tutorials for this project and learned alot about different CSS tricks, A ended up adding alot of things that I didnt plan, for example, the embedded map and google form. I originally planed of making a HTML & CSS form that wasnt functional partly becuase I couldnt find any good tutorial on how. I ended up chaing my mind becuase I thought it was important that my form actually works. The embedded map was something that I did in my free time, and I am very happy with it. I was not able to make my website very mobile friendly, even with the bootstrap grid, some things like the google form ended up being very janky. I also didnt use as much JS as I expected which made this more of a font end application. nonetheless, I learned a lot with this project.

<strong>3. Conclusions</strong>
<hr>
1. I think my main goal would try to make this more mobile friendly.
<br>
2. Another issue was the SVG's used. They were thousands of lines long and since I pasted it straight into the HTML, it made it very hard to navigate.
I know their is a solution to this, so I will fix that aswell.
